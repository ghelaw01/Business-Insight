Socioeconomic Factors and Student Academic Performance
Overview
This repository contains the research project "Evaluating the Impact of Socioeconomic Factors on Student Academic Performance." The study analyzes how socioeconomic factors such as parental education, economic status, and access to educational resources influence student achievement in math, reading, and writing.
Dataset
The analysis uses the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset, which includes information on 1,000 students with the following variables:
Demographic variables: Gender, Race/Ethnicity
Socioeconomic variables: Parental Education, Lunch Type (economic status proxy)
Educational intervention: Test Preparation Course completion
Performance metrics: Math, Reading, and Writing Scores
Research Questions
How do socioeconomic factors influence student academic performance?
Which factors have the strongest predictive power for academic outcomes?
How can these insights inform educational interventions and policies?
Key Findings
Economic status (measured by lunch type) emerged as a powerful predictor of academic achievement
Access to educational resources (test preparation) showed substantial impact on performance
Parental education level demonstrated significant but more complex relationships with student performance
Cluster analysis identified three distinct student performance profiles with clear socioeconomic associations
